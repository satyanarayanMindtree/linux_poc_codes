Pipes and Redirection

>> Redirecting Output
    > file descriptor 0 is the standard input to a program, file descriptor 1 is the standard output, and file descriptor 2 is the standard error output. 
    You can redirect each of these independently. In fact, you can also redirect other file descriptors, but it’s unusual to want to redirect any other 
    than the standard ones: 0, 1, and 2.
        example::
            $ ls -l > lsoutput.txt
            which saves the output of the ls command into a file called lsoutput.txt.
            By default, if the file already exists, then it will be overwritten. If you want to change the default behavior, you can use the command 
            set -o noclobber (or set -C ), which sets the noclobber option to prevent a file from being overwritten using redirection. You can cancel this 
            option using set +o noclobber .
        example::
            $ ps >> lsoutput.txt
            which appends output pf ps command into file lsoutput.txt.
    > To redirect the standard error output, preface the > operator with the number of the file descriptor you wish to redirect. Because the standard error 
    is on file descriptor 2, use the 2> operator. This is often use-ful to discard error information and prevent it from appearing on the screen.
        example::
            $ kill 1234 > killout.txt 2> killerr.txt
            will put the output and error information into separate files (killerr.txt).
    > If you prefer to capture both sets of output into a single file, you can use the >& operator to combine the
    two outputs. Therefore,
        example:: 
            $ kill 1234 > killouterr.txt 2>&1
    > you don’t often want to save either standard output or standard error. You can use the Linux universal “bit bucket” of /dev/null to efficiently 
    discard the entire output, like this:
        example:: 
            $ kill 1234 > /dev/null 2>&1
    
>> Redirecting Input
    > Rather like redirecting output, you can also redirect input. For example,
        example::
            $ more < killout.txt
        Obviously, this is a rather trivial example under Linux; the Linux more command is quite happy to accept filenames as parameters, unlike the Windows 
        command-line equivalent.

>> Environment Variables
$0 :: The name of the shell script.
$# :: number of parameters passed.
$$ :: The process ID of the shell script, often used inside a script for generating unique temporary filenames; for example /tmp/tmpfile_$$

>> Parameter Variables
    If your script is invoked with parameters, some additional variables are created. If no parameters are passed, the environment variable $# still 
    exists but has a value of 0.
    The parameter variables are listed in the following table:
    $1, $2, ... :: The parameters given to the script
    $*  :: A list of all the parameters, in a single variable, separated by the first character in the environment variable IFS . If IFS is modified, then
           the way $* separates the command line into parameters will change.
    $@  :: A subtle variation on $* ; it doesn’t use the IFS environment variable, so parameters are not run together even if IFS is empty.
    
    It’s easy to see the difference between $@ and $* by trying them out:
        $ IFS=’‘
        $ set foo bar bam
        $ echo “$@“
        foo bar bam
        $ echo “$*“
        foobarbam
        $ unset IFS
        $ echo “$*“
        foo bar bam
        As you can see, within double quotes, $@ expands the positional parameters as separate fields, regardless of the IFS value. In general, if you want 
        access to the parameters, $@ is the sensible choice.
    In addition to printing the contents of variables using the echo command, you can also read them by using the read command.
